# Library-Management-System

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, PHP for the back-end functionality, and MySQL for the database. It's an interactive system designed to facilitate student and staff registration at the library. Users can request, renew, and return books, with the admin having the authority to approve or reject these requests. Users can view the status of their requests on their home page, while the admin, with separate login credentials, can review and take action on user-generated requests.

Refer to the documentation file 'LMS-project-documentation.pdf' to understand all the functionalities incorporated within the system.
'prog.php' is the starting endpoint of the system to login to the system. Refer the presentation file 'LMS-project-presentation.pptx' for more info.

'LibraryManagementSystem.sql' has the required sql commands to create all the tables and foreign-key constraints necessary for the system.
